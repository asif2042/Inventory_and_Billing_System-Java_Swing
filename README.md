Inventory Management & Billing System
Welcome to MelodyMart, a comprehensive solution tailored for music and media retailers. Designed to streamline inventory management, sales, and restocking processes, it provides a powerful toolset to sellers and administrators.

Features:
Robust Inventory Management: Easily add, update, and manage various product categories such as Movies, Music albums, and Games. The system keeps track of stock levels, ensuring you're always informed.

Intuitive Dashboard: A user-friendly dashboard displays the current inventory, showcasing all available products with crucial details. Perfect for quick decision-making and inventory reviews.

Dynamic Discount System: Customers love discounts! Implement both specific product discounts and our unique "full house" offer. If a customer purchases at least two products from each category, they avail a 50% discount on the total bill.

Seamless Billing Process: Generating invoices is a breeze with MelodyMart. Detailed invoices display individual product prices, quantities, and the total amount, including any applied discounts.

Advanced Sorting and Searching: With large inventories, finding a specific product could be daunting. But not anymore! The inventory can be quickly sorted by product price or stock level. Plus, use our smart search for specifics, like movies directed by someone particular.

Restocking Made Simple: Sold out on a hot-selling album? No worries! The system notifies you about low stock products, and the restocking process is simplified for quick updates.

Administrator Tools: Special features are available for administrators to oversee sales, manage staff accounts, and get insights into best-selling products.
